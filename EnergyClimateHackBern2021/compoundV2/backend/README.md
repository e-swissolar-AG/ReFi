# Compound Sandbox

This box is meant to get developers set up with a functioning Compound (https://compound.finance) sandbox with which to build and test smart contracts on top of the protocol. It contains all of the Compound v2 smart contracts, mock ERC20 and cToken contracts, and a migration script to deploy to a local blockchain.
